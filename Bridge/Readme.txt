Bride Pattern

This code is a basic implementation of the Bridge Pattern.

Please use the Main.java in this file to run my Demo.

Each Class is named after the role it is playing in the pattern for clarity.

I decided to implement a very simple university management system where there are students and graduate students and I will make them do the registration function

So on one side we have the Abstraction of Person
Student and Graduate Student are extensions of Person each adding their own details.

Across the Bridge there is the Implementor which is a very basic interface for implementations to follow.
One of this is Register. Which is where registration functions would be performed. (I just have it print for simplicity)
