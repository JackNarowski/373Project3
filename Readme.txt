Project 3: Implementing Patterns 1
By: Jacob Narowski
UML : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eNAzaKf3JUZKoc34ndChoyyIZiVemdxy/view?usp=sharing

To run:
javaw Main.java
java Main

My Project is split into two parts (One in each file: Bridge and Observer)

Both folders have their own run Main.java file which can be used to run the code.
Each folder also has its own readme which goes into detail about each demo implementation.

As an over view:

Observer is a check in system (represented as CheckIn).
    When the user checks in one of its observers is a VisitationRecorder (VisitationRecorder) and it gets notified each time.

Bridge is a university system.
    Where there are different types of people (Student vs Graduate student)
    Both perform the function of registration, across the bridge.
